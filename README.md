# Data Science Jobs Analysis

Data science is a fascinating field that deals with vast volumes of data using modern tools and techniques to uncover hidden patterns, derive meaningful insights, and make critical business decisions. It involves employing complex machine learning algorithms to build predictive models. The data used for analysis can come from diverse sources and be presented in various formats. In today's data-driven world, data science plays a crucial role across multiple industries, making it one of the most discussed topics in the IT community.

## Project Overview

This Data Science Jobs Analysis project aims to provide valuable insights into the job landscape for data science professionals. By analyzing job postings from different years and locations, we gain a deeper understanding of trends and opportunities in the data science job market.

## Tools and Libraries

The analysis is conducted using Python, leveraging the following libraries:

- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
- Numpy: For numerical computing
- Seaborn: For data visualization
- Matplotlib: For creating plots and charts

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and is stored in the 'ds.salaries.csv' file. The dataset contains information about data science job postings, including job titles, salaries, experience levels, employment types, company sizes, and remote work ratios. You can find the dataset on Kaggle. Make sure to download the 'ds.salaries.csv' file and place it in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook for the analysis to run smoothly. Please note that since the data is sourced from Kaggle, it may be subject to their terms and conditions. Make sure to abide by the dataset's license and usage restrictions as specified on Kaggle.
## Analysis Highlights

### Job Count Based on Experience Level

We examine the job count distribution for different experience levels (Entry, Mid, Senior, Executive) over the years 2020, 2021, and 2022.

**Key Findings:** The number of entry-level jobs increased in 2021 compared to 2020 and 2022. Senior-level jobs showed continuous growth from 2020 to 2022.

### Job Count Based on Employment Type

We analyze the job count distribution for different employment types (Full-Time, Part-Time, Freelancer, Contract) over the years.

**Key Findings:** Full-time jobs witnessed significant growth over the years, especially in 2020 and 2022.

### Job Count Based on Company Size

We explore the job count distribution across different company sizes (Large, Medium, Small) over the years.

**Key Findings:** Medium-sized companies hired more in 2022, while small-sized companies had fewer job openings throughout 2020-2022, possibly influenced by the pandemic.

### Job Count Based on Remote Work Ratio

We examine the job count distribution based on the percentage of remote work offered by companies.

**Key Findings:** 2020 had the least job openings across all remote work ratios. In 2021, hybrid mode jobs were in high demand, while 2022 saw an increase in fully remote jobs.

### Top Ranked Jobs

We identify the top-ranked jobs based on the number of job openings in each year (2020, 2021, 2022).

**Key Findings:** Data Scientist consistently holds a top position, with Data Engineer and Machine Learning Engineer also ranking high.

### Top Ranked Salary

We analyze the top-ranked jobs based on average salary offerings in each year (2020, 2021, 2022).

**Key Findings:** Director of Data Science had the highest average salary in 2020, while Financial Data Analyst held the top position in 2021.

### Salary Variation Based on Features

We investigate salary variations based on different features, such as experience level, company size, employment type, and remote work ratio.

**Key Findings:** Full-time jobs generally offer higher average salaries. Salary trends vary across different experience levels and company sizes.

## Conclusion

The Data Science Jobs Analysis project provides valuable insights into the data science job market. It highlights the growth of data science jobs, the influence of company size and employment type on salaries, and the increasing demand for remote work opportunities. By understanding these trends, data science professionals can make informed decisions about their career paths and job searches.
